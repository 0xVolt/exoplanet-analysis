# A Lesson on Exploratory Data Analysis with Exoplanets
This repository houses a project on an exploratory analysis of data from NASAs Exoplanet Archive. This repository was made to document what I learnt on how to perform an EDA on different kinds of data with this dataset as an example.

My objective is to create a multi-step process to analysing any data set I'd ever come across. This step-wise process needs to be extremely versatile and should be pretty accurate to giving me as many insights about the data I've got. This process needs to be easily applicable to any kind of data so I get these results as quick as possible.
