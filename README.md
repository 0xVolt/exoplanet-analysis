## Accelerating the Data Analysis Process
This is a project on the exploratory analysis of data from NASAs Exoplanet Archive. This repository was made to document what I learnt on how to perform an EDA on different kinds of data with this dataset as an example.

The end goal is to create a multi-step process to analysing any data set I'll ever come across. This step-wise process needs to be extremely versatile and should be accurate to giving me as many insights about the data. This process needs to be easily applicable to any kind of data so I get these results as quick as possible. 

## Notes
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Before getting to the meat of the analysis, it's important to do an Exploratory Data Analysis. An EDA is an approach to summarising the key characteristics of the dataset using data visualisation among other statistical tools.
